#Todo:
- Loop training over all channels
- Add augmentations to the training
- Use transferlearning on pretrained models
- Decide on standard naming convention for photos
- Make script for testing: should use three similarly named images and 
combine predictions somehow

# Getting started:
Install required libraries:\
``pip install -r requirements.txt``
